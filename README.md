# Policy-Impact

This app simulates the impact of new policies on health outcomes. The user can adjust the parameters to see how the policy affects the prevalence of different health states over time. The simulation is based on a simple model of disease progression and does not take into account many real-world factors that would affect the outcome of a policy change.
